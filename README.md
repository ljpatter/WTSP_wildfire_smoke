The frequency and areal extent of forest fires in Albertaâ€™s Boreal Plains have increased dramatically in recent decades. Consequently, wildfire smoke has become an increasingly prevalent feature of the boreal landscape. Wildfire smoke has been shown to alter behavioural responses in many wildlife species. However, few studies have examined the effect of wildfire smoke on vocalization behaviour. The objective of this study is to determine if wildfire smoke affects avian singing rates. More specifically, I aim to quantify the extent to which smoke from wildfires affects the singing rate of White-throated Sparrows by comparing singing rates during periods with and without significant wildfire smoke. To determine this relationship, I will use bioacoustic and air quality data collected during the spring of 2023 at various locations throughout central and northern Alberta.
